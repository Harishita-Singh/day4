# Operators in python

a = int(input("Enter first number : "))
b = int(input("Enter second number : "))


#arthimetic operator

sum = a + b
print("The sum of two number is : ",sum)

sub = a - b
print("The sub of two number is : ",sub)

mult = a * b
print("The multiple of two number is : ",mult)

div = a / b
print("The division of two number is :",div)

mod = a % b
print("The mode of two number is : ",mod) #remainder

expo = a ** b
print("The exponational of number is : ",expo) #a^b


#relational operator

print(a == b)  
print(a != b)  
print(a >= b)  
print(a > b)  
print(a <= b)  
print(a < b)
